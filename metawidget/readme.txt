Metawidget Examples
===================

These examples demonstrate the use of Metawidget. Metawidget is a 'smart User
Interface widget' that populates itself, at runtime, with UI components to
match the properties of business objects. While Metawidget supports many other
user interface platforms, only the Metawidget JSF componenents are being used
in these examples.

The reason we are hosting metawidget examples are because Metawidget embraces
the same declarative style of programming that Seam espouses. Through the use
of annotations, you can control how the user interface is dynamically built and
layed out, reducing a lot of boilerplate code that you are used to writing (or
generating).

You can find information about Metawidget on the project's homepage:

Thanks to Richard Kennard for porting the original Seam examples to use the
Metawidget JSF components.
